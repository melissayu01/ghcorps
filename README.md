# Global Health Corps User Portal
Developed for [Global Health Corps](http://ghcorps.org/), this is a web app to allow users to interact with a community of volunteers and stay updated on the latest news and job/fellowship postings.

Made during the 2016 [IDHack](idhack.developersfordevelopment.org) hackathon, a [Major League Hacking](https://mlh.io/) event.
